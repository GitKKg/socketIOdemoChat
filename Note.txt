how to set up a new project with old demo codes?
1.deside which verison of ghc you should use? specified by --resolver
e.x.:proxychains stack new chat --resolver nightly-2018-05-28
snap socketio expect base<4.11.1, so you have to search "haskell base-4.11  ghc" in google to know  base-4.11.1 is bound with ghc-8.4.2
then you search "ghc-8.4.2 lts" or "ghc-8.4.2 nightly" ,then you know ghc-8.4.2 is bound with nightly-2018-05-28

so you use ghc verison package nightly-2018-05-28

proxychains stack new chat --resolver nightly-2018-05-28
cd chat

then you should install intero in you project dir at once:
proxychains stack install intero
then in emacs, open *.hs in chat dir, it will recompile intero automatically

get deps from import err message in your hs told by intero,
search their corresponding lib name in googole,add them in deps of package.yaml and stack.yaml of your project:
add dep of 
extra-deps:
    - engine-io-1.2.22
    - engine-io-snap-1.0.7
    - socket-io-1.3.11

dependencies:
- base >= 4.7 && < 5
- aeson
- stm
- text
- socket-io
- engine-io
- engine-io-snap
- snap-core
- snap-server

then:
stack build


check module lib installed:
stack exec -- ghc-pkg list

put Main**.hs of old in app,rename as Main.hs,or make them same both here and in package.yaml

put other module hs files of old in directory defined in library -> source-dirs of package.yaml
